        <p class="handguard-text">Isler Custom Gun Works started, when one day at the range, my Bride asked "why is this AR-15 so heavy?" 
            That made me think about how I could build a lightweight AR-15 that was both light and accurate.<br><br>
             My Brides' first build was all Black - then she went to a gun show and saw an AR in FDE - and it was on from there... </p><br>
   
         <p class="handguard-text">I learned a lot from that build.</p><br>
   
         <p class="handguard-text">We build 'em light, we build 'em accurate, we build 'em durable and they look good!</p>
