        <p class="handguard-text">When we install our handguards for our clientele we routinely remove the mil spec A2 front sights and install an SLR Steel or Titanium Adjustable Gas Block or whatever gas block you desire. Barrel removal and installation of upgraded barrels and upgraded muzzle brake installation are routinely performed. And heck, it doesn't have to be our handguards, it can be whatever make/look you desire!</p>
        <p class="handguard-text">Our Custom Shop can also install your handguard choice to your upper receiver and make the modifications you desire or ask for our input depending on your application.</p><br>
